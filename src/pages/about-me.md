<p>
    Hi! My name's Ed and I'm a front-end developer based in Christchurch, New Zealand. I love to build websites and apps that are <b>beautiful</b>, <b>fast</b>, <b>accessible</b> and <b>standards-compliant</b>.
</p>
<p>
    Aside from writing and reviewing high-quality code, I believe that a good front-end developer should act as an <b>advocate for the end user</b>. That means prioritising elegant UI and intuitive UX solutions and ensuring that releases are usable on all devices, from screen-reader equipped desktops to mobile phones with spotty data connections.

    Work history
</h2>
<div class="image-text">
    <div>
        <p>
            Between 2016 and 2022, I worked as a Senior Front-End Developer for <a href="https://timezoneone.com" target="blank">TimeZoneOne</a>, a full-service digital agency with offices in Chicago, IL and Christchurch, NZ.
        </p>
        <p>
            I previously lived in London, UK, where I worked for Intohand, a mobile and web development agency, and before that <a href="https://mackbooks.co.uk/" target="blank">MACK Books</a>, an art and photography publishing house.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have spent the last year living in Vancouver, Canada, and will return to New Zealand in December 2023. During my time in Canada I've worked part-time as a freelancer while also bringing up my <a href="https://github.com/wesbos/dad-jokes" title="dad jokes!" target="blank">daughter</a>, who was born in March 2022.

    Experience
</h2>
<p>
    I joined my previous employer, TimeZoneOne, as an intermediate developer in 2016, progressing to senior level in 2019. During my there, I:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Collaborated as part of a cross-discipline team, developing and maintaining web and hybrid apps for a broad range of clients.
    </li>
    <li>
        Implemented best practices for accessibility: a number of our clients were funded by the US government, and so were required to hit AA WCAG compliance as a minimum.
    </li>
    <li>
        Was involved with clients at all stages of the product life-cycle, including on-going
maintenance.
    </li>
    <li>
        Led initiatives to continually update our coding best-practice. In 2022, I led development of an update to the agencyâ€™s in-house boilerplate for web projects. This update:
        <ul>
            <li>
                increased our indicative mobile performance score on Lighthouse from <b>40</b> to <b>93</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                increased our indicative accessibility score from <b>72</b> to <b>100</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                decreased our generated CSS by <b>75%</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                decreased our generated JS by <b>50%</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                replaced monolithic, render-blocking downloads with <b>dynamic imports</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
