    Hi! My name's Ed and I'm a front-end developer based in Christchurch, New Zealand. 
I’m a front-end developer here at TimeZoneOne, working in our New Zealand office. My job is to take our digital designers’ beautiful work and bring it to life on the screen.

I’m responsible for making sure that our websites are blazing fast, easy to use and accessible to as many people as possible, whether they’re visiting on mobile phone, their desktop, or using assistive technology.
