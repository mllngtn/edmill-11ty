<p>
    Hello there! My name's Ed Millington. I'm a front-end developer based in Vancouver, British Columbia.
</p>
<p>
    This is a great place to find out more <a href="/about-me">about me</a> and my work.
</p>
<p>
    (if you're pressed for time, you can cut out the waffle and download <a href="#">my cv</a> directly!)
</p>
<p>
    This site scores 100% for page speed and accessibility in google lighthouse tests. Why not find out <a href="/about-this-site" title="how i built this site">how I built it</a> using 11ty?
</p>
<p>
    My <a href="/virtual-bookshelf" title="my virtual bookshelf">virtual bookshelf</a> — a list of all the books I've read since 2021 — is also hosted here. It is a vue app which uses pinia to store data grabbed via graphQL. The source code can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/mllngtn/edmill-11ty" title="my github account">github account</a>.
